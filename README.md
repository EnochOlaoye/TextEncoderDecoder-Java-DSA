# TextEncoderDecoder-Java-DSA

A Java command-line project that implements text encoding and decoding using custom data structures and algorithms.
Demonstrates skills in:

Data Structures & Algorithms – mapping, arrays, suffix handling

Object-Oriented Programming – modular and reusable code

File Handling – reading/writing text files via CLI

This project implements core encoding and decoding functionality, showcasing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

Features Implemented

Encode text files using a suffix-based mapping system

Decode encoded text back to its original form

Command-line interface for specifying input and output files

Modular design using Java classes for maintainability
